# School District Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to assist the school board in determining if the removal of potentially dishonest grades would significantly impact the analysis. There may have been academic dishonesty within the ninth grade reading and math scores at Thomas High School specifically. Thus we performed the district analysis in two ways in order to asses how removing the grades would impact the analysis. The district analysis was performed in the following two ways:
 - Analysis including all of the grades from the students at Thomas High School
- Analysis after removing the math and reading scores of the ninth graders at Thomas High School

## Results
